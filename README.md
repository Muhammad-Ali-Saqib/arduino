## Sensors

### 10 K Potentiometer
![10 K Potentiometer](Sensors/10%20K%20Potentiometer.jpg)
- A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.

### Active Buzzer for Arduino
